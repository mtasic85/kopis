# kopis

Kopis (aka "kopis") is a library facilitating web application development in pure Python, eliminating the need for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript.

Kopis supports almost all NPM packages, JavaScript/TypeScript, and CSS, with everything seamlessly built/bundled in the background. It is great for (both) prototyping (and production ready solutions), letting developers focus on application logic instead of dealing with the details of JS/TS bundlers. The main focus is on easy development with focus on Developer Experience (DX).
